      <p><strong>HOW THIS DPA APPLIES</strong></p>
      <p>If the Customer entity signing this DPA is a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to and forms part of the
        Agreement. In such case, the NextLabs entity that is party to the Agreement is party to this DPA.</p>
      <p>If the Customer entity signing this DPA has executed an Order Form with NextLabs or its Affiliate pursuant to the Agreement,
        but is not itself a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to that Order Form and applicable renewal Order
        Forms, and the NextLabs entity that is party to such Order Form is party to this DPA.
      </p>
      <p>If the Customer entity signing this DPA is neither a party to an Order Form nor the Agreement, this DPA is not valid
        and is not legally binding. Such entity should request that the Customer entity who is a party to the Agreement executes
        this DPA.</p>
      <p>If the Customer entity signing the DPA is not a party to an Order Form nor a Master Subscription Agreement directly
        with NextLabs, but is instead a customer indirectly via an authorized reseller of NextLabs services, this DPA is

        <li><strong> ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR EU PERSONAL DATA</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>9.1 Application of Standard Contractual Clauses. The Standard Contractual Clauses in Schedule 2 (the “Standard Contractual
        Clauses”) and the additional terms in this Section 9 will apply to the Processing of Personal Data by Data Importer
        solely in the course of providing Services, as follows:</p>
      <p>9.1.1 The Standard Contractual Clauses apply only to Personal Data that is transferred from the European Economic Area
        and/or Switzerland to outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland, either directly or via onward transfer,
        to any country or recipient: (i) not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection
        for personal data (as described in the EU Data Protection Directive), and (ii) not covered by a suitable framework
        recognized by the relevant authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data.</p>
      <p>9.1.2 The Standard Contractual Clauses apply to (i) the legal entity that has executed the Standard Contractual Clauses
        as a Data Exporter and, (ii) all Affiliates (as defined in the Agreement) of Customer established within the European
        Economic Area and Switzerland which have signed Order Forms for the Services. For the purpose of the Standard Contractual
        Clauses and this Section 9, the aforementioned entities shall be deemed “Data Exporters”.</p>
      <p>9.2 Instructions. This DPA and the Agreement are Customer’s complete and final instructions to NextLabs for the Processing
        of Personal Data. Any additional or alternate instructions must be agreed upon separately. For the purposes of Clause
        5(a) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, Customer instructs NextLabs to process Personal Data: (a) in accordance
        with the Agreement and applicable Order Form(s); and (b) as initiated by Users in their use of the Services.</p>
      <p>9.3 Sub-processors. Pursuant to Clause 5(h) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, Customer acknowledges and expressly
        agrees that (a) NextLabs’ Affiliates may be retained as Sub-processors; and (b) NextLabs and NextLabs’ Affiliates
        respectively may engage third-party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services.</p>
      <p>9.4 List of Current Sub-processors and Notification of New Sub-processors. NextLabs shall make available to Customer
        a current list of Sub-processors for the respective Services with the identities of those Sub-processors (“Sub-processor
        List”). NextLabs shall provide Customer with a mechanism to subscribe to updates to the relevant Sub-processor List,
        to which Customer shall subscribe, and NextLabs shall provide such updates before authorizing any new Sub- processor(s)
        to Process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the Services.</p>
      <p>9.5 Objection Right for new Sub-processors. If Customer has a reasonable basis to object to NextLabs’ use of a new
        Sub- processor, Customer shall notify NextLabs promptly in writing within 10 business days after receipt of NextLabs’
        notice in accordance with the mechanism set out in Section 9.4.</p>
      <p>9.5.1 In the event Customer objects to a new Sub-processor(s) and that objection is not unreasonable, NextLabs will
        use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the affected Services or recommend a commercially
        reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the affected Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data
        by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening Customer. If NextLabs is unable to make available
        such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed sixty (60) days, Customer may terminate the
        applicable Order Form(s) in respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by NextLabs without the use of
        the objected-to new Sub-processor, by providing written notice to NextLabs. Customer shall receive a refund of any
        prepaid fees for the period following the effective date of termination in respect of such terminated Services.</p>
      <p>9.5.2 The parties agree that the copies of the Sub-processor agreements that must be sent by NextLabs to Customer pursuant
        to Clause 5(j) of the Standard Contractual Clauses (a) shall be treated as the confidential information of NextLabs
        and in accordance with the Agreement, if any, and (b) may have all commercial information, or clauses unrelated to
        the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent, removed by NextLabs beforehand; and, that such copies will
        be provided by NextLabs only upon reasonable request by Customer.</p>
      <p>9.6 Audits and Certifications. The parties agree that the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the Standard
        Contractual Clauses shall be carried out in accordance with the following specifications:</p>
      <p>Upon Customer’s request, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, NextLabs shall
        make available to Customer that is not a competitor of NextLabs (or Customer’s independent, third-party auditor that
        is not a competitor of NextLabs) information regarding NextLabs’ compliance with the obligations set forth in this
        DPA in the form of the third-party certifications and audits set forth in the Security, Privacy and Architecture
        Documentation to the extent NextLabs makes them generally available to its customers. Customer may contact NextLabs
        in accordance with the “Notices” Section of the Agreement to request an on-site audit of the procedures relevant
        to the protection of Personal Data. Customer shall reimburse NextLabs for any time expended for any such on-site
        audit at NextLabs’ then-current professional services rates, which shall be made available to Customer upon request.
        Before the commencement of any such on-site audit, Customer and NextLabs shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing,
        and duration of the audit in addition to the reimbursement rate for which Customer shall be responsible. All reimbursement
        rates shall be reasonable, taking into account the resources expended by NextLabs. Customer shall promptly notify
        NextLabs with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit.</p>
      <p>9.7 Conflict. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses in
        Schedule 2, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.</p>
      <ol start="10">
        <li><strong> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Each party’s and its Affiliates’ liability arising out of or related to this DPA (whether in contract, tort or under
        any other theory of liability) is subject to the section ‘Limitation of Liability’ of the Agreement, and any reference
        in such section to the liability of a party means that party and its Affiliates in the aggregate.
