      <p><strong>3.2.</strong><strong> Protection of Your Data. </strong>We will maintain administrative, physical, and technical
        safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Your Data while we host it, as described
        in the Documentation. Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures for preventing access,
        use, modification or disclosure of Your Data by Our personnel except (a) to provide the Purchased Services and prevent
        or address service or technical problems, (b) as compelled by law in accordance with Section 8.3 (Compelled Disclosure)
        below, or (c) as You expressly permit in writing. Your Order Form shall specify how long We will host your Data.
        Where Your use of the Services includes the processing of personal data (as described in the EU Data Protection Directive
        95/46/EC) within the European Economic Area (EEA), except in respect of any usage during a Free Trial, the terms
        of the <a href="data-processing-addendum-dpa.html">Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”)</a> shall
        apply to such processing, and are hereby incorporated by reference. For the purposes of the Standard Contractual
        Clauses in Schedule 2 to the <a href="data-processing-addendum-dpa.html">DPA</a>, You are the
        data exporter, and Your acceptance of this Agreement shall be treated as Your signature of the Standard Contractual
        Clauses and appendices.</p>
      <p><strong>3.3. Retention of Your Data. </strong>We will retain Your Data within the Service for a period of 90 days at
        no charge as described in the Documentation. After that 90-day period, We will archive and make available for download

        available without the applicable Beta Services designation. We may discontinue Beta Services at any time in Our sole

        remaining at the time the subscriptions are added, and (c) any added subscriptions will terminate on the same date
        as the underlying subscriptions. Because fees are based on monthly units, fees for Subscription Licenses purchased
        in the middle of a monthly period will be charged for that monthly period in full and going forward based on the
        number of monthly periods remaining in the subscription term.</p>
      <p><strong>4.2</strong><strong> Usage Limits. </strong>Services and Content are subject to usage limits, including, for
        example, the quantities specified in Order Forms and Documentation. If You exceed a contractual usage limit, We may
        work with You to seek to reduce Your usage so that it conforms to that limit. If, notwithstanding Our efforts, You
        are unable or unwilling to abide by a contractual usage limit, You will execute an Order Form for additional quantities
        of the applicable Services or Content promptly upon Our request, and/or pay any invoice for excess usage in accordance
        with Section 6.2 (Invoicing and Payment).</p>

        Services and Content only in accordance with this Agreement, Documentation, Order Forms and applicable laws and government
        regulations, and (e) comply with terms of service of any Non-NextLabs Applications with which You use Services or

        material, or to store or transmit material in violation of third-party privacy rights, (d) use a Service or Non-NextLabs
        Application to store or transmit Malicious Code, (e) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of any

        or otherwise for Your own internal business purposes or as permitted in the Documentation, (k) access any Service
        or Content in order to build a competitive product or service or to benchmark with a Non-NextLabs product or service,
        or (l) reverse engineer any Service (to the extent such restriction is permitted by law). Any use of the Services
        in breach of this Agreement, Documentation or Order Forms, by You or Users that in Our judgment threatens the security,
        integrity or availability of Our services, may result in Our immediate suspension of the Services, however We will
        use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide You with notice and an opportunity to remedy
        such violation or threat prior to such suspension.</p>
      <p><strong>4.5</strong><strong> Removal of Content and Non-NextLabs Applications. </strong>If We are required by a licensor
        to remove Content, or receive information that Content provided to You may violate applicable law or third-party
        rights, We may so notify You and in such event You will promptly remove such Content from Your systems. If We receive
        information that a Non-NextLabs Application hosted on a Service by You may violate Our External-Facing Services or
        applicable law or third-party rights, We may so notify You and in such event You will promptly disable such Non-NextLabs
        Application or modify the Non-NextLabs Application to resolve the potential violation. If You do not take required
        action in accordance with the above, We may disable the applicable Content, Service and/or Non-NextLabs Application
        until the potential violation is resolved.</p>
      <p><strong>5. NON-NEXTLABS PROVIDERS</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5.1.</strong> We or third parties may make available third-party products or services, including, for example,
        Non-NextLabs Applications and implementation and other consulting services. Any acquisition by You of such products
        or services, and any exchange of data between You and any Non-NextLabs provider, product or service is solely between
        You and the applicable Non-NextLabs provider. We do not warrant or support Non- NextLabs Applications or other Non-NextLabs
        products or services, whether or not they are designated by Us as “certified” or otherwise, unless expressly provided
        otherwise in an Order Form.</p>
      <p><strong>6. FEES AND PAYMENT FOR PURCHASED SERVICES</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6.1.</strong><strong> Fees. </strong>You will pay all fees specified in Order Forms. Except as otherwise specified
        herein or in an Order Form, (i) fees are based on Services and Content subscriptions purchased and not actual usage,
        (ii) payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) quantities purchased cannot
        be decreased during the relevant subscription term.</p>
      <p><strong>6.2.</strong><strong> Invoicing and Payment. </strong>You will provide Us with valid and updated credit card
        information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to Us. If You provide credit
        card information to Us, You authorize Us to charge such credit card for all Purchased Services listed in the Order
        Form for the initial subscription term and any renewal subscription term(s) as set forth in Section 12.2 (Term of
        Purchased Subscriptions). Such charges shall be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different
        billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. If the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method
        other than a credit card, We will invoice You in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form.
        Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, invoiced charges are due net 30 days from the invoice date. You are responsible
        for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Us and notifying Us of any changes to such
        information.</p>
      <p><strong>6.3.</strong><strong> Overdue Charges. </strong>If any invoiced amount is not received by Us by the due date,
        then without limiting Our rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the
        outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) We may condition
        future subscription renewals and Order Forms on payment terms shorter than those specified in Section 6.2 (Invoicing
        and Payment).</p>
      <p><strong>6.4.</strong><strong> Suspension of Service and Acceleration. </strong>If any amount owing by You under this
        or any other agreement for Our services is 30 or more days overdue (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of amounts
        You have authorized Us to charge to Your credit card), We may, without limiting Our other rights and remedies, accelerate
        Your unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable,
        and suspend Our services to You until such amounts are paid in full. Other than for customers paying by credit card
        or direct debit whose payment has been declined, We will give You at least 10 days’ prior notice that Your account
        is overdue, in accordance with Section 13.2 (Manner of Giving Notice) for billing notices, before suspending services
        to You.</p>
      <p><strong>6.5.</strong><strong> Payment Disputes. </strong>We will not exercise Our rights under Section 6.3 (Overdue
        Charges) or 6.4 (Suspension of Service and Acceleration) above if You are disputing the applicable charges reasonably
        and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. You must notify us in writing if you dispute
        any portion of any fees paid or payable by you under this Agreement. You must provide that written notice to us within
        sixty (60) days of the applicable charge and we will work together with you to resolve the applicable dispute promptly.
        If you do not provide us with this written notice of your fee dispute within this 60 day period, you will not be
        entitled to dispute any fees paid or payable by you.</p>
      <p><strong>6.6.</strong><strong> Taxes. </strong>Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental
        assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any
        jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “<strong>Taxes</strong>”). You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated
        with Your purchases hereunder. If We have the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which You are responsible
        under this Section 6.6, We will invoice You and You will pay that amount unless You provide Us with a valid tax exemption
        certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, We are solely responsible for taxes assessable
        against Us based on Our income, property and employees.</p>
      <p><strong>6.7.</strong><strong> Future Functionality. </strong>You agree that Your purchases are not contingent on the
        delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Us
        regarding future functionality or features.</p>
      <p><strong>7. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7.1.</strong><strong> Reservation of Rights. </strong>Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder,

        applicable contractors a worldwide, limited-term license to, as reasonably necessary for Us to provide the Services
        in accordance with this Agreement i) host, copy, transmit and display Your Data, created by or for You using a Service
        or for use by You with the Services, and (ii) if and to the extent agreed by Us in the Order Form, host, copy, transmit
        and display Non-NextLabs Applications’ program code or code created specifically by or for You using a Service or
        for use by You with the Services. Subject to the limited licenses granted herein, We acquire no right, title or interest
        from You or Your licensors under this Agreement in or to any of Your Data, Non-NextLabs Application or such program
        code.</p>
      <p><strong>7.4.</strong><strong> License to Use Feedback</strong>. You grant to Us and Our Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual,
        irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into Our and/or Our Affiliates’ services any suggestion,
        enhancement request, recommendation, correction or other feedback provided by You or Users relating to the operation
        of Our or Our Affiliates’ services.</p>
      <p><strong>7.5.</strong><strong> Federal Government End Use Provisions</strong>. We provide the Services, including related
        software and technology, for ultimate federal government end use solely in accordance with the following: Government
        technical data and software rights related to the Services include only those rights customarily provided to the
        public as defined in this Agreement. This customary commercial license is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211
        (Technical Data) and FAR 12.212 (Software) and, for Department of Defense transactions, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical
        Data – Commercial Items) and DFAR 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).
        If a government agency has a need for rights not granted under these terms, it must negotiate with Us to determine
        if there are acceptable terms for granting those rights, and a mutually acceptable written addendum specifically
        granting those rights must be included in any applicable agreement.</p>
      <p><strong>8. CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8.1.</strong><strong> Definition of Confidential Information. </strong>“<strong>Confidential Information</strong>”
        means all information disclosed by a party (“<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>”) to the other party (“<strong>Receiving Party</strong>”),
        whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential
        given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Your Confidential Information includes Your
        Data; Our Confidential Information includes the Services and Content; and Confidential Information of each party
        includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order Forms (including pricing), as well as business
        and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed
        by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally
        known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving
        Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party,
        (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently
        developed by the Receiving Party.</p>
      <p><strong>8.2.</strong> The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality
        of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential
        Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise
        authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to
        those of its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with this
        Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections not materially
        less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein. Neither party will disclose the terms of this
        Agreement or any Order Form to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel and accountants without the
        other party’s prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal
        counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s, legal counsel’s or accountant’s compliance with
        this “Confidentiality” section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, We may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any
        applicable Order Form to a subcontractor or Non-NextLabs Application Provider to the extent necessary to perform
        Our obligations to You under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set forth
        herein.</p>
      <p><strong>8.3.</strong><strong> Compelled Disclosure</strong>. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information
        of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing
        Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the
        Disclosing Party&#8217;s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is
        compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which
        the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party
        will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential
        Information.</p>
      <p><strong>9. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND DISCLAIMERS</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9.1.</strong><strong> Representations. </strong>Each party represents that it has validly entered into this

        WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGES CAUSED

        of the Claim Against You, (b) give Us sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against You (except
        that We may not settle any Claim Against You unless it unconditionally releases You of all liability), and (c) give
        Us all reasonable assistance, at Our expense. If We receive information about an infringement or misappropriation
        claim related to a Service, We may in Our discretion and at no cost to You (i) modify the Services so that they are
        no longer claimed to infringe or misappropriate, without breaching Our warranties under “NextLabs Warranties” above,
        (ii) obtain a license for Your continued use of that Service in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) terminate
        Your subscriptions for that Service upon 30 days’ written notice and refund You any prepaid fees covering the remainder
        of the term of the terminated subscriptions. The above defense and indemnification obligations do not apply to the
        extent a Claim Against You arises from Content, a Non-NextLabs Application or Your use of the Services in violation
        of this Agreement, the Documentation or applicable Order Forms.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.2.</strong><strong> Indemnification by You. </strong>You will defend Us against any claim, demand, suit
        or proceeding made or brought against Us by a third party alleging that any of Your Data infringes or misappropriates
        such third party’s intellectual property rights, or arising from Your use of the Services or Content in violation
        of the Agreement, the Documentation, Order Form or applicable law (each a “Claim Against Us”), and You will indemnify
        Us from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against Us as a result of, or for any amounts paid by
        Us under a settlement approved by You in writing of, a Claim Against Us, provided We (a) promptly give You written
        notice of the Claim Against Us, (b) give You sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Us (except
        that You may not settle any Claim Against Us unless it unconditionally releases Us of all liability), and (c) give
        You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.</p>
      <p><strong>10.3.</strong><strong> Exclusive Remedy. </strong>This Section 10 states the indemnifying party’s sole liability
        to, and the indemnified party’s exclusive remedy against, the other party for any type of claim described in this
        Section 10.</p>
      <p><strong>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11.1.</strong><strong> Limitation of Liability. </strong>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH
        PARTY TOGETHER WITH ALL OF ITS AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID
        BY YOU AND YOUR AFFILIATES HEREUNDER FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING
        THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION WILL APPLY WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN
        CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, BUT WILL NOT LIMIT YOUR AND YOUR AFFILIATES’ PAYMENT
        OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE “FEES AND PAYMENT” SECTION ABOVE.</p>
      <p><strong>11.2.</strong><strong> Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages. </strong>IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY
        OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES,
        GOODWILL, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER
        AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE
        BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF A PARTY’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ REMEDY OTHERWISE FAILS OF ITS
        ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.</p>
      <p><strong>12. TERM AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12.1 Term of Agreement. </strong>This Agreement commences on the date You first accept it and continues until
        all subscriptions hereunder have expired or have been terminated.</p>
      <p><strong>12.2.</strong><strong> Term of Purchased Subscriptions. </strong>The term of each subscription shall be as
        specified in the applicable Order Form. Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form, subscriptions will automatically
        renew for additional periods equal to the expiring subscription term or one year (whichever is shorter), unless either
        party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the end of the relevant subscription term. Except
        as expressly provided in the applicable Order Form, renewal of promotional or one-time priced subscriptions will
        be at Our applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal. Notwithstanding anything to the
        contrary, any renewal in which subscription volume for any Services has decreased from the prior term will result
        in re-pricing at renewal without regard to the prior term’s per-unit pricing.</p>
      <p><strong>12.3.</strong><strong> Termination. </strong>A party may terminate this Agreement for cause (i) upon 30 days
        written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period,
        or (ii) if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency,
        receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>
      <p><strong>12.4.</strong><strong> Refund or Payment upon Termination. </strong>If this Agreement is terminated by You
        in accordance with Section 12.3 (Termination), We will refund You any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the
        term of all Order Forms after the effective date of termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Us in accordance
        with Section 12.3, You will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Order Forms. In no event
        will termination relieve You of Your obligation to pay any fees payable to Us for the period prior to the effective
        date of termination.</p>
      <p><strong>12.5.</strong><strong> Your Data Portability and Deletion. </strong>Upon request by You made within 30 days
        after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement or as set forth in the applicable Order Form,
        We will make Your Data available to You for export or download as provided in the Documentation. After such period,
        We will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Your Data, and as provided in the Documentation will thereafter
        delete or destroy all copies of Your Data in Our systems or otherwise in Our possession or control, unless legally
        prohibited.</p>
      <p><strong>12.6.</strong><strong> Surviving Provisions. </strong>The sections titled “Fees and Payment,” “Proprietary
        Rights and Licenses,” “Confidentiality,” “Disclaimers,” “Mutual Indemnification,” “Limitation of Liability,” “Refund
        or Payment upon Termination,” “Customer Data Portability and Deletion,” “Removal of Content and Non-NextLabs Applications,”
        “Surviving Provisions” and “General Provisions” will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
      <p><strong>13. NOTICES, GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13.1.</strong><strong> Manner of Giving Notice. </strong>Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
        notices related to this Agreement will be in writing and will be effective upon (a) personal delivery, (b) the second
        business day after mailing, or (c), except for notices of termination or an indemnifiable claim (“<strong>Legal Notices</strong>”),
        which shall clearly be identifiable as Legal Notices, the day of sending by email. Billing-related notices to You
        will be addressed to the relevant billing contact designated by You. All other notices to You will be addressed to
        the relevant Services system administrator designated by You.</p>
      <p><strong>13.2.</strong><strong> Agreement to Governing Law and Jurisdiction. </strong>These Terms will be governed by
        and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws and principles
        that would cause laws of another jurisdiction to apply. These Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Convention
        on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related
        to these Terms or our Services shall be instituted in either the state or federal courts of San Mateo, California,
        and we each consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.</p>
      <p><strong>13.3.</strong><strong> No Agency. </strong>For the avoidance of doubt, We are entering into this Agreement
        as principal and not as agent for any other NextLabs, Inc. company. Subject to any permitted Assignment under Section
        14.4, the obligations owed by Us under this Agreement shall be owed to You solely by Us and the obligations owed
        by You under this Agreement shall be owed solely to Us.</p>
      <p><strong>14. GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14.1.</strong><strong> Export Compliance. </strong>The Services, Content, other technology We make available,
        and derivatives thereof may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions.
        Each party represents that it is not named on any U.S. government denied-party list. You shall not permit Users to
        access or use any Service or Content in a U.S. embargoed country (currently Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria
        or Crimea) or in violation of any U.S. export law or regulation.</p>
      <p><strong>14.2.</strong><strong> Anti-Corruption. </strong>You agree that You have not received or been offered any illegal
        or improper bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any of Our employees or agents in connection with
        this Agreement. Reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business do not violate the
        above restriction. If You learn of any violation of the above restriction, You will use reasonable efforts to promptly
        notify Our Legal Department at <a href="mailto:legal@nextlabs.com">legal@nextlabs.com</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>14.3 Entire Agreement and Order of Precedence. </strong>This Agreement is the entire agreement between You
        and Us regarding Your use of Services and Content and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals
        or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. Except as otherwise provided herein, no modification,
        amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party
        against whom the modification, amendment or waiver is to be asserted. The parties agree that any term or condition
        stated in Your purchase order or in any other of Your order documentation (excluding Order Forms) is void. In the
        event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence shall be: (1) the applicable
        Order Form, (2) this Agreement, and (3) the Documentation.</p>
      <p><strong>14.4.</strong><strong> Assignment. </strong>Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder,
        whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
        withheld); provided, however, either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety (together with all Order Forms),
        without the other party’s consent to its Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization,
        or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to
        the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
      <p><strong>14.5.</strong><strong> Relationship of the Parties. </strong>The parties are independent contractors. This
        Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between
        the parties.</p>
      <p><strong>14.6.</strong><strong> Third-Party Beneficiaries. </strong>There are no third-party beneficiaries under this

      </p>
      <p><strong>14.7.</strong><strong> Waiver. </strong>No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under this
        Agreement will constitute a waiver of that right.</p>
      <p><strong>14.8.</strong><strong> Severability. </strong>If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void, and the remaining provisions of this
